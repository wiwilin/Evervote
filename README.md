# EverVote

EverVote makes voting in UMSU elections easy and accessible, while holding representatives accountable. The live online voting means voters can respond to political issues in real time, wherever they are. The liquid voting allows each vote to be reallocated by its recipients, so every student can have their vote cast in their interests, even if they aren't politically engaged.
